# unreal-project

> A starter template with UnrealJS included

## What's this?

An project template maker/manager that downloads UnrealJS and it's dependencies from Github and set's them up for you.

## Why

* I was suprised the amount of people having trouble and the effort needed for adding UnrealJS to an Unreal Project.
* Easy and fast.

## Install
```sh
npm i -g --save unreal-project
```
## Usage
```sh
mkdir my-project && cd my-project && unrealproject
```
